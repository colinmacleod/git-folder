# Test Summary for Phase 2

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests Created

1. **SSH Service Tests** (`src/services/ssh.test.ts`)
   - ✅ SSH key pair generation
   - ✅ Unique key generation
   - ✅ Encryption/decryption functionality
   - ✅ Wrong key decryption failure
   - ✅ Different encrypted output for same input
   - Database-dependent tests (require full test setup)

2. **Auth Middleware Tests** (`src/middleware/auth.test.ts`)
   - ✅ Dev mode user creation
   - ✅ Session checking in production mode
   - ✅ Authentication state management
   - ✅ Error handling
   - ✅ requireAuth and optionalAuth functions

3. **User Model Tests** (`src/models/User.test.ts`)
   - CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Validation rules
   - Unique constraints
   - Relationships with other models
   - Timestamp management

4. **Auth API Tests** (`src/api/auth.test.ts`)
   - Auth status endpoint
   - Dev mode login
   - Logout functionality
   - OAuth redirects

5. **User API Tests** (`src/api/user.test.ts`)
   - User profile management
   - Preferences endpoints
   - SSH key generation
   - SSH key upload/download
   - Authentication requirements

## Test Results

### Core Functionality (Verified)
- ✅ SSH key generation works correctly
- ✅ Encryption/decryption with AES-256-GCM works
- ✅ Auth mode detection works
- ✅ Basic middleware logic is sound

### Test Framework Issues
- Vitest is set up and configured
- Circular dependency issues in models when running full test suite
- TypeScript/JavaScript module resolution challenges

## Recommendations

1. **For Production**: The core functionality has been manually tested and works correctly
2. **For CI/CD**: May need to adjust test setup to handle TypeScript compilation before tests
3. **Alternative**: Consider using a simpler test approach or running tests against compiled JavaScript

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (once module issues are resolved)
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run simple verification tests
npx tsx src/test/simple-test.ts
```
