# Git Integration - Phase 3 Summary

## Implemented Components

### 1. Git Command Wrapper (`GitCommand.ts`)
- Low-level Git command execution with timeout and buffer limits
- Repository detection and initialization
- Clone, add, commit, push, pull operations
- Branch listing and management
- Git LFS support (detection, installation, tracking)
- Comprehensive error handling

### 2. Repository Service (`RepositoryService.ts`) 
- Repository creation (new or clone from URL)
- SSH key management for authenticated operations
- Automatic Git LFS setup with default patterns for creative files
- Repository listing, info, and deletion
- Initial commit with README

### 3. File Operations Service (`FileOperations.ts`)
- List files and folders
- Upload files with automatic LFS detection
- Download file streaming
- Delete and move/rename operations
- File version history
- Get file content at specific version

### 4. Branch Service (`BranchService.ts`)
- List branches with last commit info
- Create and switch branches
- Delete branches (with safety checks)
- Merge branches
- Compare branches (ahead/behind)

### 5. Repository API Endpoints (`/api/repositories`)
- `GET /` - List user's repositories
- `GET /:id` - Get repository details
- `POST /` - Create new repository
- `POST /:id/lfs` - Initialize Git LFS
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete repository

## Git LFS Integration

Automatically tracks common large file types used by creatives:
- Design files: .psd, .ai, .sketch, .fig, .xd
- 3D models: .blend, .fbx, .obj, .3ds, .max
- Video: .mov, .mp4, .avi
- Audio: .wav, .mp3, .flac
- Archives: .zip, .rar, .7z

Files over 50MB (configurable) are automatically tracked with LFS.

## Security Features

- SSH keys are temporarily written to disk for Git operations
- Keys are encrypted in database and decrypted only when needed
- Temporary keys are cleaned up after operations
- Repository paths are sandboxed under user ID directories

## Error Handling

- Custom GitError class for Git-specific errors
- Meaningful error messages for common scenarios
- Proper cleanup on failures
- Comprehensive logging

## Next Steps

To complete the File Management API:
1. Create file upload/download endpoints
2. Add version history endpoint
3. Implement progress tracking for large files
4. Add chunked upload support
5. Create file operation logging
